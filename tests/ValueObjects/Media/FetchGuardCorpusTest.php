/**
 * The cross-language `media-fetch-guard` corpus from `prism-parity`.
 *
 * This package is the REFERENCE, so this file's job is narrower than the
 * ports' equivalents will be: it is not proving the guard is right — the
 * hostile cases beside it do that — it is proving the CORPUS has not drifted
 * from the code it was recorded against, so that when a port later says "I
 * match the reference", the thing it matched is still what the reference
 * produces.
 *
 * Two of three columns are deliberately empty today (G-63). This suite is the
 * failing corpus the ports get built against, rather than a description of
 * them written afterwards.
