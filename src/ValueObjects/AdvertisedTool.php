/**
 * A tool the model was offered, reduced to what a listener may always see.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Telemetry withholds the request when
 * `prism.telemetry.capture_content` is off, which is the default — so a
 * listener is told nothing about the tools. That is right for the tool
 * DEFINITIONS, which carry descriptions, and wrong for the fact that a tool set
 * exists and what shape it has.
 *
 * The cost of not having this was measured by a consumer. Providers cache a
 * prompt PREFIX, and the tool array is part of that prefix, so a span could be
 * used to diff most of what was cached and not all of it: a cache miss caused
 * by the system prompt was diagnosable, and one caused by a skill granting
 * tools mid-turn was invisible. The diagnosis SUCCEEDED on one cause and was
 * silently blind to another, which is worse than not having it — it reads as
 * "the prefix is stable".
 *
 * A name and a digest are not content. They are authored by the application,
 * not by the user and not by the model, which is the line `capture_content`
 * draws. So they travel unconditionally, exactly as {@see ProviderRateLimit}
 * does and for the same reason: the thing is only useful BEFORE you have a
 * problem, and gating it behind a switch nobody turns on in production means it
 * is absent precisely when it is wanted.
